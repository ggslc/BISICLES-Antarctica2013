BISICLES-Antarctica2013 is a collection of programs and notes related
to the use of BISICLES (http://bisicles/lbl.org) to carry out simulations
of the Antarctic ice sheet (either the whole ice sheet, or regions of it).
The intention is that anyone that has BISICLES itself can use these programs
and notes to

1. Obtain the freely-available geometry and velocity data
2. Obtain (non-free for now) temperature data
3. Pre-process the data from 1. and 2. to provide inputs for BISICLES
